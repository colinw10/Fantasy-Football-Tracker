# Fantasy-Football-Tracker 🏈

This is an application to give fantasy football managers another way to keep track of their team/teams' stats week to week or over the course of a full season.  
All you have to do is create a player and add your player to the roster then insert stat lines for each player. Fantasy Points will be calculated automatically.
